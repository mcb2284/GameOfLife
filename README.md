# GameOfLife

### **1. Project Name:**

- **Game of Life**

### **2. Project Description:**

- A web-based simulation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), built using
  Next.js. Users can set initial configurations, start and pause simulations, and observe the evolution of patterns over
  time.

### **3. Core Features:**

- **Interactive Grid:** Users can click on cells to activate or deactivate them, setting up initial patterns.
- **Simulation Controls:** Play, pause, step-through, and reset buttons to control the simulation.
- **Speed Adjuster:** Adjust the speed of the simulation.
- **Patterns Library:** A collection of predefined patterns that users can load and observe.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

### **4. Technical Overview:**

- **Frontend (React):**
    - **Pages:**
        - **Home Page:** Contains the grid, controls, and patterns library.
        - **About Page:** Information about the Game of Life and its rules.
    - **State Management:** Use React's useState and useContext for managing the state of the grid and the simulation
      status.
    - **Styling:** Utilize CSS Modules or a library like `styled-components` for styling.

- **Backend (Node.js with Next.js API routes):**
    - **API Routes:**
        - `/api/save`: Save a particular configuration of the game.
        - `/api/load`: Load a saved configuration.
    - **Database:** Use a simple database (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB) to store saved configurations.
    - **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for API routes.

- **Deployment:**
    - Use Vercel (the platform built by the creators of Next.js) for seamless deployment. Alternatively, platforms like
      Netlify or DigitalOcean App Platform can be used.

### **5. Stretch Goals:**

- **User Accounts:** Implement authentication to allow users to save and manage multiple configurations.
- **Simulation History:** Allow users to rewind and fast-forward through simulation states.
- **Community Patterns:** Let users share their patterns with the community, with upvoting and commenting features.
- **Dark Mode:** Add a toggle for dark and light themes.

### **6. Development Plan:**

1. **Project Initialization:** Set up a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`.
2. **Frontend Development:**
    - Develop the interactive grid and simulation controls.
    - Implement the patterns library feature.
    - Add routing for the home and about pages.
3. **Backend Development:**
    - Set up the database for storing configurations.
    - Develop the API routes for saving and loading configurations.
4. **Styling:** Make the application visually appealing and responsive.
5. **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests using libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a hosting platform.
7. **Feedback and Iteration:** Gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

With this overview, you have a clear roadmap to start building your "Game of Life" project with Next.js. Remember to
prioritize core features first and then move on to the stretch goals as time allows. Good luck with your project!
